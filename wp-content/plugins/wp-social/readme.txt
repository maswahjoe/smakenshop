[Wp Social](https://wpmet.com/plugin/wp-social) lets you add social login, social counter, and social share buttons of different styles to your WordPress website.

A website without traffic is lame, but a website that hates social media is doomed to extinction (Yeah, a viral fever has spread all over, but the world craves for it!)

You might feel decision fatigue to find 3 individual plugins for social login, social counter, and social share to keep your website paced with social media.

Well, why exhaust your website with multiple plugins when only one robust social media plugin can do what you want?

Welcome to WP Social.

WP Social is an advanced social media plugin with social login, social counter, and social share features. It brings all your social media channels together without much ado!

This amazing plugin allows your visitors to login to your site using their social accounts and share your content on different social media platforms. You can also display the number of your fans and followers along with linking the icons to your social channels.

Unleash the power of social media integration features that you can configure effortlessly from the WordPress admin panel. You can also enable/disable any features of it to make sure you implement what's important for you.

##Social Register/Login##

Social register/login buttons will make the login process for your visitors easy and simple. With social login, your website visitors can register and log in to your site through dozens of popular social networks seamlessly.

As a website owner, you can manage custom login redirect URL, show or hide social login buttons for different pages including wp-login, wp register, comment, WooCommerce login, WooCommerce register, and much more.

WP Social integrates 9 social login providers that’ll allow your visitors login to your website within seconds via Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dribbble, GitHub, WordPress, Vkontakte, and Reddit.

Wp Social Login features WordPress Social login and register, Woocommerce Social login and register, BuddyPress Social login and register, Facebook login, Twitter login, Linkedin login, Dribble login, Pinterest login, WordPress login, and Instagram login from your WordPress site.

The social login offers a bunch of beautifully crafted readymade designs that will give your login button an extra classy look.

Just put the login authorization details in the admin panel and you are ready to use this plugin on your site.

##Social Share##

Do you want your visitors to share your web content to the social media platforms just by a click on the social media icons? Leverage the social share feature from WP Social to get your work done.

With the social share feature, your visitors can easily share the post or content from your website to any of the 15 most popular social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.

This set of social share buttons will help your users directly share anything with their friends and followers of respective social media.

When it comes to styling, you can choose from readymade styles for displaying the share buttons on your website. On top of that, you can determine the layout either as horizontal or vertical.

And last but not least, you are at complete liberty to show or hide the share count to your visitors.

##Social Counter##

Well, now is the time to introduce you to the social counter buttons.

Do you prefer to showcase the number of social media fans, subscribers, and followers to the visitors of your website? No worries, we have integrated a social counter feature in WP Social for you.

This feature will give you the means to count your social media fans and display the numbers to the visitors.

With this feature, you can impress your potential followers by showing the number of subscribers, fans, and followers you have earned with 15 providers including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

Like others, this feature also offers extensive options to select from 15+ hover effects and icon styles such as flat icons, rounded icons, hover effect, color effect, metro style, etc.

We have extensive options to activate this feature with your social media details and select one of the readymade designs from beautifully designed templates.

You can use either widget or shortcode to display your social media counter and shares right on your website in your desired locations!

You can determine the cache hours to store the counter data for a certain period of time.
